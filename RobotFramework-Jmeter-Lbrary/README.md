## LAMPP

See https://askubuntu.com/a/936552

AMPP stands for Apache, MariaDB, PHP and Perl. It's a slight variation of the common LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack.

XAMPP is a suite of software that is available for Linux, Windows and macOS. The "X" is a generic placeholder for the platform.

The Linux version of XAMPP is also known as LAMPP. I think you can guess what WAMPP and MAMPP are, as well.
